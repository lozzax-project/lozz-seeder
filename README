About this Project
------------------

This is an extremely simple DNS seeder that ensures the Lozzax DNS seed A records are
fully populated. It's written in php-cli, and it's a little hacky in parts. It works
with Gandi's API only, which means there is no requirement for running your own BIND
server. Feel free to port this to python if you don't like semi-hacky php-cli code.
